How to use it                                             *cheat.sh-how-to-use* ~

The easiest way to use this plugin is to use one of the following mappings :
The easiest way to use this plugin is to use one of the following mappings :

+ `K` get answer on the word under the cursor or the selection on a pager (this
feature requires vim >= 7.4.1833, you can check if have the right version with :
`:echo has("patch-7.4.1833")`)
+ `<leader>KK` same as `K` but works on lines or visual selection (not working
on neovim, because they killed interactive commands with `:!`)
+ `<leader>KB` get the answer on a special buffer
+ `<leader>KR` Replace your question by the answer
+ `<leader>KP` Past the answer below your question
+ `<leader>KC` Replay last query, toggling comments
+ `<leader>KE` Send first error to cht.sh
+ `<leader>C` Toggle showing comments by default see |cheat.sh-configuration|
+ `<leader>KL` Replay last query

The plugins also provides four main commands :
>
    :Cheat
    :CheatReplace
    :CheatPast
    :CheatPager
<
+ These commands takes 0 or 1 argument.
+ If you give no argument, it will send the language of the current buffer and
the visual selection (or the current line / word in `normal` mode) as a plus
query to cheat.sh and show the answer in a new buffer (`:Cheat`), in place of
your question (`:CheatReplace`) or in a pager (`:CheatPager`).
+ If one argument is given, you can complete it from a list of available cheat
sheets or write your own [query](https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh#search).
+ They also take a `bang` that make same transform the query into a plus query:
for instance : `:Cheat! factory` is the same as `:Cheat &ft/factory+`.

HowIn                                                          *cheat.sh-howin* ~

The `:HowIn` command takes exaclty one argument.

If the argument is one word, it is interpreted as a filetype (language), and
the current line (or word, depending on |cheat.sh-configuration|) is sent as a
query for this given language.
Else the first word of the query should be a  filetype.

Examples :

>
    # Current postion in the buffer :
    with open('foo') as f:
    :HowIn javascript
<
Or
>
    :Howin javascript open file
<


Frameworks                                                *cheat.sh-frameworks* ~

When you open a buffer, cheat.sh-vim will try to guess if you are using a
framework (see |cheat.sh-framework-detection|) and if a framework is found, it
will send queries using your framework instead of your filetype.

There are also some mappings to change the current framework :

 + `<leader>Kt` : Use filetype instead of framework
 + `<leader>KT` : Use autodetected framework
 + `<leader>Kf` : Use next defined framework for current filetype
 + `<leader>KF` : Use previous defined framework for current filetype

The available Frameworks can be overriden with the following code (adapt to
your needs) :
>
    let g:CheatSheetFrameworks = {
                \ 'python' : ['python', 'django', ],
                \ 'javascript' : ['javascript', 'node', 'angular', 'jquery'],
                \ 'php' : ['php', 'symphony', 'yii', 'zend'],
                \}

As you can see the list is far from being exhaustive, please contribute if you
modify it (see below).

                                            *cheat.sh-frameworks-detection*

This functionnality is in early stage and help is wanted to improve it.
To detect framework, the plugin go through the list of defined framework for
the current filetype. The following dictionnary tells the plugin how to detect
a few frameworks.
>
    let g:CheatSheetFrameworkDetectionMethods = {
                    \'django' : { 'type' : 'file', 'value' : 'manage.py' },
                    \'symfony' : { 'type' : 'file', 'value' : 'symfony.phar' },
                    \'jquery' : {'type' :'search', 'value' : 'jquery.*\.js'},
                    \}

This dictionnary can be overriden by the user.

There are three types of detections :

1. 'file' : 'value' is an argument for the `find` command to locate a file
`find . -name "value"`
2. 'search', 'value' is a pattern that should be present in the current file
3. 'func' : 'value' is the name of a user defined function which should return
something true if the framework is detected. The function takes one argument
which is the name of the framework we are currently testing for.

Please report any contribution on the followin issue, or do MR (PR) on gitlab
(resp github).

<Ids                                                              *cheat.sh-ids* ~

You can manage ids through the  `:CheatId` command :

    :Cheat[!] [newid]         " Generates a new id or set id to newid
                              " Id will not be overwritten if ! is not given
    :Cheat remove             " Completely removes the id

Id is used to replay query from different clients

Errors                                                        *cheat.sh-errors* ~

Cheat.sh-vim can directly send the syntaxt and compilation errors / warning to
cht.sh. To do so, hit `<leader>KE` or run `:CheatError`.

By default, the answer will be displayed on the cheat buffer, to change this
behavior :
>
    let g:CheatSheetDefaultMode = x
<
Where x is :

+ 0 : Cheat buffer (default)
+ 1 : Replace current line (sounds like a very bad idea)
+ 2 : Use the pager
+ 3 : Append answer below current line (sounds like a bad idea)

Error providers                                     *cheat.sh-errors-providers* ~

Currently errors are search from the quickfix, then from syntastic errors.
To change this order :
>
    let  g:CheatSheetProviders = ['syntastic', 'quickfix']
<

You can easily add an error provider in 5 steps :

1. Copy the file `cheat.sh/autoload/cheat/providers/quickfix.vim` to
`cheat.sh/autoload/cheat/providers/myprovider.vim`
2. Adapt and rename the function (only change quickfix in the name), it must
return the error string without special chars or an empty string if there are
no errors / warning
3. Add your provider name (filename) to the `CheatSheatProvider` list in
`cheat.sh/autoload/cheat/providers.vim`
4. Test it
5. Do a merge request on [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/dbeniamine/cheat.sh-vim/)

Syntastic hooks                                       *cheat.sh-syntastic-hook* ~

Cheat.sh-vim uses syntastic hooks to retrieve the error list, if you also need
to use synstastic hook, make sure that your function calls ours with the initial
error list :

    function SyntasticCheckHook(errors)
        call cheat#providers#syntastic#Hook(a:errors)
        " Do whatever you want to do
    endfunction



Navigate                                                    *cheat.sh-navigate* ~

Once you have called on of these commands, you can navigate through questions,
answers and related with the following mappings :

+ `<leader>KQN` Next Question
+ `<leader>KAN` Next Answer
+ `<leader>KSN` Next "See also"
+ `<leader>KHN` Next in history
+ `<leader>KQP` Previous Question
+ `<leader>KAP` Previous Answer
+ `<leader>KSP` Previous "See also"
+ `<leader>KHP` Previous in history

In the cheat buffer, the following mappings are available :

+ `<localleader>h` Previous Answer
+ `<localleader>j` Next Question
+ `<localleader>k` Previous Question
+ `<localleader>l` Next Answer
+ `<localleader>H` Previous history
+ `<localleader>J` Next "See also"
+ `<localleader>K` Previous "See also"
+ `<localleader>L` Next history

You can also directly use the function :
>
    :call cheat#navigate(delta, type)
<
Where delta is a numeric value for moving (1, or -1 for next or previous) And
type is one of : `'Q'`, `'A'`, `'S'`, `H` (history), and `C` (replay last
query, toggling comments).

For instance :
>
    :call cheat#navigate(-3, 'A')
<
goes back three answers before the current

When navigating, the same mode (pager, buffer, replace) is used as for the last
request.

This plugin provides a `:Cheat` command to browse cheat sheets from vim. This
command takes one argument : a Cheat.sh
query (https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh#search), and supports completion.

Configuration                                          *cheat.sh-configuration* ~

Every parameter used to retrieve and display the cheat sheet can be changed,
to do so, just put the following in you vimrc and ajust to your needs (these
are the default values that will be used if you do not change them) :

    let g:CheatSheetDefaultSelection="line"

    " Default query mode
    " 0 => buffer
    " 1 => replace (do not use or you might loose some lines of code)
    " 2 => pager
    " 3 => paste after query
    " 4 => paste before query
    let g:CheatSheetDefaultMode=0

    " Make plugin silent by  setting bellow variable to 1
    let g:CheatSheetSilent=0

     Path to cheat sheet cookie
    let g:CheatSheetIdPath=expand('~/.cht.sh/id')
